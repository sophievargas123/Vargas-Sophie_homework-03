**WARNING:** this document provides the foundation for your homework 3, but you will need to create your own neat, organized document to render for your homework submission. Create a new document for your homework in the `code` folder of this repository.   

**You will not need all the information in this document to do your homework; IT IS YOUR JOB TO EDIT THE INFORMATION IN YOUR HOMEWORK DOCUMENT TO ONLY INCLUDE WHAT IS NECESSARY.**    

**Relevant definitions:**  

specific leaf area (SLA, units: mm^2^/g): surface area of a leaf divided by its dry mass, represents life strategy (high SLA = large surface area and low mass = "fast" species)  

root mass (units: g): mass of root tissue  

shoot mass (units: g): mass of aboveground tissue

# Visualizing

## correlations 

```{r correlations-with-ggpairs}
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-width: 8

ggpairs(drought_exp_clean, # data frame
        columns = c("leaf_dry_weight_g", # columns to visualize
                    "sla", 
                    "shoot_g", 
                    "root_g", 
                    "total_g"), 
        upper = list(method = "pearson")) + # calculating Pearson correlation coefficient
  theme_bw() + # cleaner theme
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) # getting rid of gridlines
```

Choose 3 pairs of variables to compare. Make notes of those comparisons below.    

Leaf weight has a positive relationship with total biomass (Pearson's r = 0.46).  

SLA has a positive relationship with shoot mass (Pearson's r = 0.35).  

Shoot mass has a positive relationship with root mass (Pearson's r = 0.55).

## Preliminary visualizations  

If you aren't familiar with each plant species, google them!  

Then go exploring! Visually.  

In this scenario, we're interested in how three variables affect total biomass: species (categorical), water treatment (categorical), specific leaf area (SLA, numeric).  

**Note:** it is totally ok (and encouraged) to explore these separately!

### how does total biomass differ between species?

```{r mass-as-a-function-of-species}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5

ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = reorder(species_name, # reordering x-axis
                       -total_g, # in reverse order of mean total mass
                       fun = mean), # calculating mean to reorder
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**Grindelia has highest biomass, Lotus has lowest, seem to all be different**

### how does total biomass differ between water treatments?

```{r mass-as-a-function-of-water-treatment}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = water_treatment, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**mass in well watered treatment is higher than in drought stressed treatment**

### how does specific leaf area (SLA) influence total biomass?

```{r mass-as-a-function-of-sla}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = sla, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_point() # scatterplot
```

**SLA seems to have a positive relationship with total mass - as SLA increases, total mass does too**

# Model construction

What is the null model?  

0. **total biomass is not predicted by any of these variables**  

What is the saturated model?  

1. **total biomass as a function of SLA, water treatment, and species**  

In class we are going to try two more models:  

2.  **total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment**  
3.  **total biomass as a function of SLA and species**  

For homework, you will construct two more models:  

4. **total biomass as a function of water treatment and species**  

You will then compare all 5 models to determine which best describes total biomass. **For your homework, you will need to create a table summarizing the structure of these models.**

## 0. Null model

```{r null-model0}
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, # formula
             data = drought_exp_clean) # data frame
```

## 1. total biomass as a function of SLA, water treatment, and species

```{r saturated-model1}
# saturated model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model1)
# you might get a warning when you run this code - that is ok!
```

## 2. total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment

```{r simpler-model2}
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model2)
```

## 3. total biomass as a function of SLA and species

```{r simpler-model3}
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model3)
```

# Model selection

From the `MuMIn` package

```{r model-selection}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3)
```

Out of the four models we have tried, the best model is the one that includes **insert predictors here**  

Note that this may change once you fit and compare the other model!

# Model summary

```{r model-summary}
summary(model1)
```

What are the reference levels?  

- reference for `water_treatment`  
- reference for `species_name`  

**reference for water_treatment:** drought stressed  
**reference for species_name:** Encelia californica  

Interpret the model estimates for the:  

- intercept  
- SLA slope  
- well watered estimate  
- Lotus scoparius estimate  
- Stipe pulcra estimate  

**Intercept:** Encelia californica mass when SLA = 0 in drought stressed treatment  
**slope:** across water treatment levels and species, for each 1 mm^2^/g increase in SLA, you would expect 0 increase in mass. Another way of stating this is: there is _no effect of SLA on mass_.  
**well watered estimate:** across species and SLA OR on average, plants in well watered treatment are 0.12 ± 0.019 g greater than plants in drought stressed treatment  
**_Lotus scoparius_ estimate:** across water treatments and SLA OR on average, _Lotus scoparius_ plants were -0.23 ± 0.032 g less than _Encelia californica_.  
**_Stipa pulchra_ estimate:** across water treatments and SLA or on average, _Stipa pulchra_ plants are the same size as _Encelia californica plants._

# Model predictions

**Note:** only plot terms in the model you select - if your doesn't include one of these terms, take it out and adjust the plotting code accordingly!

```{r model-predictions-data-frame}
model_preds <- ggpredict(model1, 
                         terms = c("sla",
                                   "water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

# use View(model_preds) to see the predictions as a data frame
# use model_preds to see the predictions formatted nicely
```

# Visualization

**Note:** this is the quick way to visualize model predictions. For your homework, you may find it easier to plot things yourself (i.e. not using the `plot()` functionality within `ggeffects`). See lecture for an example of how to do this.  

```{r model-predictions-with-ggeffects}
# plot function within ggeffects
plot(model_preds, # model predictions
     limit_range = TRUE, # limit the range of predictions to the range of predictor values
     show_data = TRUE) + # show the underlying data
  # everything below this is ggplot() stuff
  theme_classic() + # classic theme
  labs(title = "Preliminary model visualization") + # plot title
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) # getting rid of gridlines
```

The "more customizable" way:

```{r model-predictions-with-ggplot}
# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting
model_preds_for_plotting <- model_preds %>% 
  rename(sla = x, # renaming columns to make this easier to use
         water_treatment = group,
         species_name = facet)

# use View(model_preds_for_plotting) 
# to compare this to the original model_preds data frame

ggplot() +
  # underlying data
  geom_point(data = drought_exp_clean,
             aes(x = sla,
                 y = total_g,
                 color = water_treatment)) +
  # model prediction 95% CI ribbon
  geom_ribbon(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
              aes(x = sla, 
                  y = predicted,
                  ymin = conf.low,
                  ymax = conf.high,
                  fill = water_treatment),
              alpha = 0.2) +
  # model prediction lines
  geom_line(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
            aes(x = sla, 
                y = predicted,
                color = water_treatment)) +
  # cleaner theme
  theme_classic() +
  # creating different panels for species
  facet_wrap(~species_name) 
```


# Making a table

```{r model-tables}
# one option for a single model
flextable::as_flextable(model1) 

# another option for a single model
gtsummary::tbl_regression(model1)

# comparing models
modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
  list( 
    "null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
    "model 1" = model1,
    "model 2" = model2,
    "model 3" = model3
  )
) 

```

**Note 1: notice all the information at the bottom of the `modelsummary` output - if you only needed the AIC and delta AIC, what could you do? see package documentation for help**

**Note 2: you will always have to report the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, test statistic, p-value, ⍺, and R^2^. Whether or not this information is in a table is up to you.**
