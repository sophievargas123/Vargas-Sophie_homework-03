**WARNING:** this document provides the foundation for your homework 3, but you will need to create your own neat, organized document to render for your homework submission. Create a new document for your homework in the `code` folder of this repository.   

**You will not need all the information in this document to do your homework; IT IS YOUR JOB TO EDIT THE INFORMATION IN YOUR HOMEWORK DOCUMENT TO ONLY INCLUDE WHAT IS NECESSARY.**    

**Relevant definitions:**  

specific leaf area (SLA, units: mm^2^/g): surface area of a leaf divided by its dry mass, represents life strategy (high SLA = large surface area and low mass = "fast" species)  

root mass (units: g): mass of root tissue  

shoot mass (units: g): mass of aboveground tissue

## cleaning

```{r}

drought_exp_clean <- drought_exp %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # nicer column names
  mutate(species_name = case_when( # adding column with species scientific names
    species == "ENCCAL" ~ "Encelia californica", # bush sunflower

    species == "SALLEU" ~ "Salvia leucophylla", # Purple sage
    species == "STIPUL" ~ "Nasella pulchra", # Purple needlegrass

  )) %>% 
  relocate(species_name, .after = species) %>% # moving species_name column after species
  mutate(water_treatment = case_when( # adding column with full treatment names
    water == "WW" ~ "Well watered",
    water == "DS" ~ "Drought stressed"
  )) %>% 
  relocate(water_treatment, .after = water) # moving water_treatment column after water
```

# Visualizing

## correlations 

```{r}
ggpairs(drought_exp_clean, # data frame
        columns = c("leaf_dry_weight_g", # columns to visualize
                    "sla", 
                    "shoot_g", 
                    "root_g", 
                    "total_g"), 
        upper = list(method = "pearson")) + # calculating Pearson correlation coefficient
  theme_bw() + # cleaner theme
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) # getting rid of gridlines
```

Choose 3 pairs of variables to compare. Make notes of those comparisons below.    

**The total mass is strongly positively correlated with the mass of the shoots (Pearson's r = 0.902).**  

**The shoot mass is positively correlated with the specific leaf area (Pearson's r = 0.348).**  

**The root mass is positively correlated with the shoot mass (Pearson's r = 0.553). **

## Preliminary visualizations  

If you aren't familiar with each plant species, google them!  

Then go exploring! Visually.  

In this scenario, we're interested in how three variables affect total biomass: species (categorical), water treatment (categorical), specific leaf area (SLA, numeric).  

**Note:** it is totally ok (and encouraged) to explore these separately!

### how does total biomass differ between species?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = reorder(species_name, # reordering x-axis
                       -total_g, # in reverse order of mean total mass
                       fun = mean), # calculating mean to reorder
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**Plants with larger biomass seem to have larger ranges. Grindelia has highest biomass and Acrispon has lowest biomass.**

### how does total biomass differ between water treatments?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = water_treatment, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**The total biomass is lower in the drought stressed water treatment compared to the well watered treatment. Well watered plants tend to have larger biomass. This makes sense based on how plants work.**

### how does specific leaf area (SLA) influence total biomass?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = sla, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_point() # scatterplot
```

**Specific leaf area doesn't really effect total biomass when looking visually but it is important to check correlation to compare visual and statistical.**

# Model construction

What is the null model?  

0. **total mass is not predicted by any of the three predictors.**  

What is the saturated model?  

1. **total mass predicted by SLA, water treatment, and species.**  

In class we are going to try two more models:  

2.  **total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment**  
3.  **total biomass as a function of SLA and species**  

For homework, you will construct one more model:  

4. **total biomass as a function of water treatment and species**  

You will then compare all 5 models to determine which best describes total biomass. **For your homework, you will need to create a table summarizing the structure of these models.**

## 0. Null model

```{r}
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, # formula
             data = drought_exp_clean) # data frame
```

## 1. total biomass as a function of SLA, water treatment, and species

```{r}
# saturated model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model1)
# you might get a warning when you run this code - that is ok!
```

## 2. total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment

Diagnostics for saturated model look good.

```{r}
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model2)
```

## 3. total biomass as a function of SLA and species

***Look at diagnostics later!***

```{r}
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model3)
```

***Look at the diagnositics later!***

# Model selection

From the `MuMIn` package

```{r}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3)
```
**AIC fro best model is always 0**

Out of the four models we have tried, the best model is the one that includes **Of the four models we have tried, the bes model is the one that contaons all three predictores ( sla, water treatment, species)**  

Note that this may change once you fit and compare the other model!
***look at diagnostics again***

# Model summary

```{r}
summary(model1)
```

What are the reference levels?  

- reference for `water_treatment`  
- reference for `species_name`  

**reference for water_treatment:** **water_treatment_Drought_stress**  
**reference for species_name:** **species_nameAcmispan**   

Interpret the model estimates for the:  

- intercept: **mass of Acmispan glober in drought stressed treatment when SLA = 0**  
- SLA slope: **across drought tretaments and species, with each 1 unit increase in SLA (mm^2/dry mass of leaf), we expect an increase in total mass of -0.00025 WHICH MEANS WITH THE ESTIMATE NAD STANDARD ERROR THER EIS NO EFFECT OF SLA ON TOTAL MASS.**  
- well watered estimate: **Across species and SLA, well watered plants tend to be 0.12 +- (figure out how to write plus and minus in text) 0.02 g heavier than drought stressed plants.** 

- Lotus scoparius estimate: **insert response here**    
- Stipa pulchra estimate: **insert response here**    

# Model predictions

**Note:** only plot terms in the model you select - if your doesn't include one of these terms, take it out and adjust the plotting code accordingly!

```{r}
model_preds <- ggpredict(model1, 
                         terms = c("sla",
                                   "water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

# use View(model_preds) to see the predictions as a data frame
# use model_preds to see the predictions formatted nicely
```

# Visualization

**Note:** this is the quick way to visualize model predictions. For your homework, you may find it easier to plot things yourself (i.e. not using the `plot()` functionality within `ggeffects`). See lecture for an example of how to do this.  

```{r}
# plot function within ggeffects
plot(model_preds, # model predictions
     limit_range = TRUE, # limit the range of predictions to the range of predictor values
     show_data = TRUE) + # show the underlying data
  # everything below this is ggplot() stuff
  theme_classic() + # classic theme
  labs(title = "Preliminary model visualization") + # plot title
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) # getting rid of gridlines
```

The "more customizable" way:

```{r}
# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting
model_preds_for_plotting <- model_preds %>% 
  rename(sla = x, # renaming columns to make this easier to use
         water_treatment = group,
         species_name = facet)

# use View(model_preds_for_plotting) 
# to compare this to the original model_preds data frame

ggplot() +
  # underlying data
  geom_point(data = drought_exp_clean,
             aes(x = sla,
                 y = total_g,
                 color = water_treatment)) +
  # model prediction 95% CI ribbon
  geom_ribbon(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
              aes(x = sla, 
                  y = predicted,
                  ymin = conf.low,
                  ymax = conf.high,
                  fill = water_treatment),
              alpha = 0.2) +
  # model prediction lines
  geom_line(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
            aes(x = sla, 
                y = predicted,
                color = water_treatment)) +
  # cleaner theme
  theme_classic() +
  # creating different panels for species
  facet_wrap(~species_name) 
```


# Making a table

```{r}
# one option for a single model
flextable::as_flextable(model1) 

# another option for a single model
gtsummary::tbl_regression(model1)

# comparing models
modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
  list( 
    "null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
    "model 1" = model1,
    "model 2" = model2,
    "model 3" = model3
  )
) 

```

**Note 1: notice all the information at the bottom of the `modelsummary` output - if you only needed the AIC and delta AIC, what could you do? see package documentation for help**

**Note 2: you will always have to report the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, test statistic, p-value, ⍺, and R^2^. Whether or not this information is in a table is up to you.**
